# MGDW

This simple script is used to download manga from Mangaread. It needs a couple
of programs to works properly:

- [jq](https://github.com/jqlang/jq)
- [img2pdf](https://github.com/myollie/img2pdf)
- [aria2](https://github.com/aria2/aria2)
- [curl](https://curl.se/)
- rename
- [exiv2](https://exiv2.org/)

The GPL-2.0 license is added to respect other programs that it depends on.
